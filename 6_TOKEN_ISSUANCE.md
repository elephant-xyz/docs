# Stage 6: Token Issuance

**Objective:** Reward oracle agents for successful contributions.

Upon the successful minting of a property's data, the Elephant Protocol's smart contract automatically rewards the participating oracles with tokens.

## Token Rewards

There are two types of tokens issued:

-   **vMahout**: A non-transferable token that serves as a testament to an oracle's verified contributions to the network. Think of it as a reputation score.
-   **Mahout**: A transferable token that represents economic and governance rights within the protocol. This token is issued when the data provided by the oracle is used by protocol providers.

## Distribution

Tokens are automatically distributed to the registered wallet address of the oracle. This automated process ensures that oracles are promptly and fairly compensated for their work in maintaining the integrity and accuracy of the protocol's data.
